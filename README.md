## My thoughts on the project
The project was very informative. It was a good starting point for anyone who wants to try their hands on the QT framework. Understanding of objects and classes in C++ is very crucial for this framework. According to me, one can start with QT easily as there are a lot of resources available but to develop something serious it might take some time to fully understand the core integration working behind.
In all, it was an amazing learning experience.
